# Machine-Learning-Use-cases
These are some use-cases where I did a feasibility study on how to use Machine Learning for prediction / analysis on Automotive data.

Classification problem: To be able to predict the car tier (Basic, Plus or Premium) given other related data.

Regression problem: To be able to predict how many times a certain car advertisment is clicked on.

Image Classification: To classify and predict images of BMW, Audi and Mercedes cars using CNN.
